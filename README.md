# Plant_Monitoring
IoT project using Cayenne  and ESP8266 Thing Dev Board

## Getting Started
Create an account with MyDevices: https://mydevices.com/
Once you have created an account, click on `All Devices` and select the SparkFun ESP8266 Thing Dev Board. 
From this page you'll see the steps required to connect as well as the info you need in your Arduino Sketch like the MQTT username and password, Client ID, server and port info and you can also name your baord.

Be sure to install the Cayenne libraries.

Once your project is up and running - navigate to the user menu on the top right side of the  window and slect `Triggers and Alerts`. Add a new trigger by naming it and then dragging the board name on the left side of the window into the `if` box. 
Then click on the `then` box and set up your email or phone number. When the event you choose happens you'll either get an email or a text message! 

In this Repo, in the folder named IoP, you'll find a template to help you get started even faster.

I'm a fan of dataWrapper for those who do not want to program. It all cut/paste and design around templates on the site.
