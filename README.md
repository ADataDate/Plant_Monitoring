# Plant_Monitoring
IoT project using Cayenne  and ESP8266 Thing Dev Board

## Getting Started
Create an account with MyDevices: https://mydevices.com/
Once you have created an account, click on `All Devices` and select the SparkFun ESP8266 Thing Dev Board. 
From this page you'll see the steps required to connect as well as the info you need in your Arduino Sketch like the MQTT username and password, Client ID, server and port info and you can also name your baord.

Be sure to install the Cayenne libraries. 

In this Repo, in the folder named IoP, you'll find a template to help you get started even faster.

You will also need hook-up wire, soldering iron and solder, a power supply, plastic wrap for the temp sensors, and heat shrink. 

## Helpful Data Processing info
For those aquainted with Python:

DataWrapper:

I'm a fan of dataWrapper for those who do not want to program. It all cut/paste and design around templates on the site.
